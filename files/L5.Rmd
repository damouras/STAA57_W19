## Lecture Goals 

- Learn how to:
    + Work w/ relational data
    + Join/merge data-frames
    + Append/bind data-frames
 
- Readings 
    + [R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/): ch. 13
    + Data Wrangling [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)


## Relational Data

- **Databases** are organized collections of data 
    + Implemented through some *DB Management Systems* (e.g. Oracle)

- Majority of DBs use **relational model** of data ogranization
    + Data live in multiple inter-related tables
    + *SQL* is standard language for managing relational DB's 

## Relational Data

## Keys 

- Tables are connected through variable(s) called **keys**
    + Keys are used to identify/relate observations
     
- Two types of keys
    + **Primary** keys *uniquely* identify observations *within a table*
    + **Foreign** keys *associate* observations with those in *other tables*

## Relationships 

- Primary/foreign key pairs establish **relationships** between tables

- Three types of relationships
    + **One-to-one**: primary-primary pair
    + **One-to-many**: primary-foreign pair
    + **Many-to-many**: (primary-foreign) [*junction table*] (foreign-primary) pairs 


## Mutating Joins

- Expand left/right table with variables from other table, matching observations where possible 

![](img/left_join.PNG)

```{r, include = FALSE}
x = data_frame(V1=1:3, V2=c("a","b","c"))
y = data_frame(V1=c(1,3,4), V3=c(F,T,F))
x %>% inner_join(y, by="V1")
x %>%  full_join(y)
```

## Mutating Joins

- Merge tables' variables, keeping *only matching* (inner join) or *all* (full join) observations

![](img/inner_join.PNG)

```{r, include = FALSE}
x %>% inner_join(y, by="V1")
x %>%  full_join(y)
```


## Filtering Joins

- Filter observations in one table, based on whether they *match* (semi join) or *not* (anti join) with other table

![](img/filter_join.PNG)


```{r, include = FALSE}
x %>% semi_join(y, by="V1")
x %>%  anti_join(y)
```


## Set Operations 

- Operations on sets or observations (rows) with the same variables

![](img/set_ops.PNG)

```{r, include = FALSE}
x = data_frame(V1=1:2, V2=c("a","b"))
y = data_frame(V1=2:3, V2=c("b","c"))
union(x,y)
intersect(x,y)
setdiff(x,y)
```


## Binding

- Append table rows/columns 

![](img/binding.PNG)


```{r, include = FALSE}
x = data_frame(V1=1:2, V2=c("a","b"))
y = data_frame(V1=3:4, V3=c("c","d"))
bind_cols(x,y)
bind_rows(x,y)
```
