## Lecture Goals 

- Understand fundamental concepts of statistical inference
    + Population vs Sample 
    + Parameter vs Statistic
    + Sampling Variability & Bias 
- Apply basic sampling strategies 
    + Simple and Stratified Random Sampling


- Readings 
    + [ISRS](https://www.openintro.org/download.php?file=isrs1_tablet&referrer=/stat/textbook.php): ch. 1.3-1.4


## Why Statistics?

- Goal: answer questions about a **population**
    + Population: collection of *all objects of interest* (actual or notional)
    + E.g. What is average age of people living in Canada?
    
- *Precise* answer for entire population requires **census**
    + E.g. Ask *everyone* living in Canada (cost ~$700mil!)
    + Typically either impracticable or impossible

- Alternatively *sample* the population 


## Sampling 

- **Sample** is subset of population that helps answer question  *"approximately"*   
![](./img/population_sample.PNG)

- Answer quality depends critically on how sample is collected 


##  Parameters & Statistics

- Answers typically expressed as statements about summary measure of interest 
    + **Parameter**: summary of entire population
    + **(Sample) Statistic**: summary of sample

## Notation

- Continuous Variables

|  Description | Parameter | Statistic | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mean/Avg | $\mu$ | $\hat{\mu}/\bar{X}$ | 
| Std Deviation | $\sigma$ | $S$ | 
| Median | $\mu_{1/2}$ | $M$ | 

- Discrete Variables

|  Description | Parameter | Statistic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Proportion | $p$ | $\hat{p}$ | 


## Example

- Dinesafe data: interested in average number of inspections per establishment

```{r, message=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
pop = dinesafe %>% 
  group_by(ESTABLISHMENT_ID) %>% 
  distinct(INSPECTION_ID) %>% 
  summarise( N_INSPECTIONS = n() ) 
pop %>% summarise( mean(N_INSPECTIONS) ) 
pop %>% sample_n(100) %>% summarise( mean(N_INSPECTIONS) )
```


## Variability

- Statistic value varies with different samples 
    + **Sampling variability** is extent to which statistics diverge from their mean

- Sampling variability can be controlled by the **sample size** ($n$)
    + Larger $n$ $\rightarrow$ lower variability (higher accuracy)

## Example

- Distribution of statistics (avg # of inspections) of different sample sizes

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4 }
parameter = pop %>% summarise( mean(N_INSPECTIONS) ) %>% pull()
n_reps = 1000
statistics = matrix(0, nrow = n_reps, ncol = 2)
for(i in 1:n_reps){
  sample_vector = sample(pop %>% pull(N_INSPECTIONS), 100)
  statistics[i,1] = mean( sample_vector )
  statistics[i,2] = mean( sample_vector[1:10] )
}
colnames(statistics) = c("n = 100","n = 10")
statistics %>% as.tibble() %>% 
  gather( "size", "statistic", 1:2) %>% 
  ggplot( aes(x = statistic, fill = size) ) +
  geom_density( alpha = .5 ) + 
  geom_vline( xintercept = parameter, lty = 2 ) +
  geom_text( x = 3.4, y = .2, label = "parameter", hjust = -0.1 )

```


## Bias

- Statistic changes with different samples, so how do we pick our sample?

- Regularities in sampling can lead to **bias**, i.e. systematic deviation of statistic from parameter
    + E.g. collect data by email only
    
- To avoid selection bias & improve representativeness, most sampling methods involve **randomness**



## Simple Random Sampling 

- **Sampling frame**, i.e. list of available objects for sampling
    + Ideally covers entire population 

- **Simple Random Sample (SRS)**: every object sampled *randomly and with equal probability*
    + Avoids bias when no other information is available 
    + Average of *all* SRS averages equal to population average

## Example

- Distribution of statistics from different sampling frames (SRS, $n=100$)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4 }
pop2 = dinesafe %>% 
  filter( ESTABLISHMENTTYPE == "Restaurant") %>% 
  group_by(ESTABLISHMENT_ID) %>% 
  distinct(INSPECTION_ID) %>% 
  summarise( N_INSPECTIONS = n() ) 

n_reps = 1000
statistics = matrix(0, nrow = n_reps, ncol = 2)
for(i in 1:n_reps){
  statistics[i,1] = mean( sample(pop %>% pull(N_INSPECTIONS), 100) )
  statistics[i,2] = mean( sample(pop2 %>% pull(N_INSPECTIONS), 100) )
}
colnames(statistics) = c("all establishments","restaurants")
statistics %>% as.tibble() %>% 
  gather( "frame", "statistic", 1:2) %>% 
  ggplot( aes(x = statistic, fill = frame) ) +
  geom_density( alpha = .5, position =  ) + 
  geom_vline( xintercept = parameter, lty = 2 )+
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "sampling frame") +
  geom_text( x = 3.4, y = .2, label = "parameter", hjust = -0.1 )

```


## Potential Problems 

- Randomness alone is not enough for representativeness
    + Must pay attention to sampling details
    
Two common sources of bias are:

- **Participation or Non-response bias**: *respondents* are not representative of entire population
   
- **Coverage bias**: sampling frame does not align well with population


## Stratified Sampling 

- Population often divided into groups, called *strata*

- **Stratified Sampling** combines SRS from every straturm to ensure representation 
     + Samples proportional to strata sizes

## Example

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5 }
pop3 = dinesafe %>% 
  group_by(MINIMUM_INSPECTIONS_PERYEAR, ESTABLISHMENT_ID) %>% 
  distinct(INSPECTION_ID) %>% 
  summarise( N_INSPECTIONS = n() ) 

n_reps = 1000
NN=integer(n_reps)
statistics = matrix(0, nrow = n_reps, ncol = 2)
for(i in 1:n_reps){
  statistics[i,1] = pop %>% sample_frac(0.004) %>% pull(N_INSPECTIONS) %>% mean()
  strat.sample = pop3 %>% group_by(MINIMUM_INSPECTIONS_PERYEAR) %>%
    sample_frac(0.004) %>% pull(N_INSPECTIONS)
  NN[i]=length(strat.sample)
  statistics[i,2] = mean( strat.sample )
}

colnames(statistics) = c("SRS","Stratified by min Insp/Year")
statistics %>% as.tibble() %>% 
  gather( "method", "statistic", 1:2) %>% 
  ggplot( aes(x = statistic, fill = method) ) +
  geom_density( alpha = .5, position =  ) + 
  geom_vline( xintercept = parameter, lty = 2 )

pop3 %>% group_by(MINIMUM_INSPECTIONS_PERYEAR) %>% 
  summarise(mean(N_INSPECTIONS), n()) 

```

## Observational vs Experimental Studies 

- **Observational studies** collect data by *observing* what happens (no intervention)
     + E.g. survey sampling, polls, etc. 

- **Experiments** collect data after *manipulating* aspects of the process
     + E.g. drug testing 

- Observational studies are used for *descriptions* (what *is* happening), whereas experiments are used for *decisions* (what *should* be done)
