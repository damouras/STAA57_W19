## Lecture Goals 

- Understand fundamentals of hypothesis testing
    + Formulating hypotheses
    + Calculating test statistics
    + Interpreting P-values
- Perform randomization tests for comparisons 
    
- Readings 
    + [ISRS](https://www.openintro.org/download.php?file=isrs1_tablet&referrer=/stat/textbook.php): ch. 2.1-2.4


## Hypothesis Testing

- **Hypothesis**: claim about population, e.g.
    + Proposal will pass popular vote
    + Women are paid less than men
    + Drug X is more effective than drug Y

- **Hypothesis testing**: procedure for determining validity of hypothesis *based on sample evidence* 

## Test Statistic

- Associate hypothesis with a **test statistic**, i.e. quantity calculated from data

- E.g. Interested in whether proposal will pass popular vote
    + Test statistic is *proportion* of favourable votes

- To assess hypothesis, need to know *behaviour* of test statistic
    + Compare statistic to its *sampling distribution* under hypothesis
    

## Null & Alternative Hypotheses 

- For every claim there are two competing hypotheses: the claim and its opposite
    + E.g. proposal will pass vs it will *not* pass

- **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$): *Reference* hypothesis, representing baseline or status quo 
    + Used for deriving test's sampling distribution 

- **Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_A$ or $H_1$): Opposite of $H_0$
     + Almost always corresponds to claim of interest


## Data Tribunal

- Hypothesis testing resembles legal trial
    + *Presume* innocence
    + Present *evidence*; if it is inconsistent with innocence, declare guilty
    + *Burden of proof is on showing guilt*

- Similarly in a hypothesis test
    + *Presume* null hypothesis ($H_0$) is true 
    + Collect data; if *test statistic* is inconsistent with $H_0$, reject it and adopt $H_A$
    + *Burden of proof is on alternative*  

## Example

- Out of SRS of 100 individuals, 59 are in favor of proposal 
    + Want to know if proposal will pass referendum
    
- $H_0: p \leq .5$ vs $H_A: p>.5$
    + $p$ is (population) proportion in favor

- Test statistic is **sample** proportion $\hat{p} = .59$ 
     - Compare to sampling distribution under borderline value ($p=.5$)


## Example

- Approximate sampling distribution under $H_0$ ($p=.5$) by simulating 1,000 test statistic values

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
sim = tibble( value = replicate( 1000,sample( 0:1, 100, replace = TRUE ) %>% mean() ) ) 
sim
```

## Example 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='hide',message=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
sim %>% ggplot(aes(x = value)) + geom_histogram(bins = 30)  + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = .59) + xlab( "proportion in favor" )
```


## P-value

- **P-value**: probability that sampling distribution under $H_0$ gives values *at least as favorable* to $H_A$ as observed statistic 
    + Lower P-value $\rightarrow$ data less *consistent* with $H_0$ 

![](./img/pvalue_1side.PNG)

- Compare P-value to *predetermined* cut-off, called **significance level** ($\alpha$)
    + "Typical" value of $\alpha = .05 = 1/20$ 
    + If P-value $< \alpha \rightarrow$  reject $H_0$ & accept $H_A$ 


## P-value Guidelines 


- Typical interpretation of P-values

| Range | Compatibility with $H_0$ | 
|---|---|
| P-value > 0.10 |	no evidence against $H_0$ |
| 0.05 < P-value < 0.10	| weak evidence against $H_0$ |
| 0.01 < P-value < 0.05	| moderate evidence against $H_0$ |
| 0.001 < P-value < 0.01 | strong evidence against $H_0$ |
| P-value < 0.001	| very strong evidence against $H_0$ |



## Example

- P-value for hypothesis test 
```{r, collapse = TRUE}
sim %>% summarise( mean( value >= .59 ) ) %>% pull()
```
- Reject $H_0$ at $\alpha = 5\%$ significance level $\Rightarrow$ conclude proposal will pass (go with $H_A$)

- What would happen if 
     + $\alpha = .01$?
     + $H_0: p \geq .5$ vs $H_A: p < .5$?

## Two-Sided tests

- In certain cases want to test against *both* directions of alternative
    + E.g. test if coin-tossing is *fair*, i.e. proportion of heads is 50%
    + Two-sided hypothesis: $H_0: p = .5$ vs $H_A: p \neq .5$  

- Similar approach, but calculate P-value as probability of equal or more extreme *absolute distance* from hypothesized value 

![](./img/pvalue_2side.PNG)


## Example

- Flip coin 500 times and get 267 heads; is there evidence of bias at 5% significance level?

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
set.seed(123)
sim = replicate( 1000, sample( 0:1, 500, replace = TRUE ) %>% mean() ) 
(P_value = mean( abs(sim - .5) >= (276/500 - .5) ))
```

- FYI, coin flipping is [*not exactly fair*](https://econ.ucsb.edu/~doug/240a/Coin%20Flip.htm)
    


## Comparisons 

- Hypothesis tests are commonly used for **comparisons**, typically of averages or proportions
     + E.g. are women paid differently than men?
     
- Hypothesis can be expressed it terms of parameter **difference**
    + E.g. $H_A: \mu_W \neq \mu_M \Leftrightarrow H_A:\mu_W-\mu_M \neq 0$

- Use *sample difference* in averages/proportions as *test statistic* 
    

## Randomization Test

- Under null hypothesis, parameters of two groups (1 & 2) are equal   
    + $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ or $H_0: p_1=p_2$

- Idea: if populations are similar, then group information *does not matter* 

- **Randomization/Permutation test**: approximate sampling distribution under $H_0$ by repeatedly shuffling groups randomly and calculating their difference


## Example


- Are women paid differently than men?
    + $H_0: \mu_W - \mu_M = 0$ vs $H_A: \mu_W - \mu_M \neq 0$

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
lfs = read_csv('../data/LFS_Toronto.csv') 
lfs %>% filter( educ == 5) %>% 
  mutate( sex = factor(sex, levels = 1:2, labels = c("M","F"))) %>% 
  ggplot( aes(x = sex, y = hrlyearn) ) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

## Example

- Run permutation test using `coin` package
    + `independence_test()` for hypothesis test 
    + $H_0$: no difference in `hrlyearn` for different `sex` 
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, collapse = TRUE}
library(coin)
lfs %>% filter( educ == 5) %>% 
  mutate( sex = factor(sex, levels = 1:2, labels = c("M","F")) ) %>% 
  independence_test( hrlyearn ~ sex, data = ., 
      alternative = "two.sided", distribution = "approximate" )
```
