## About the course

- [**Science**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science): systematic organization & creation of *knowledge*, in form of *testable* explanations/predictions about the world

- [**Data Science**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science): field that uses scientific methods to *extract knowledge & insights from data* 
     + [*Scientific method*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) invloves  making conjectures and testing them using observation or experimentation.

<br>

- In short, this course is about **answering questions using data**.


## About the course

- Unfortunately, cannot answer *every* question using data.

<br>

- But certain *types* of questions can be reasonably addressed with data
    + **Estimation**: What % of the population gets the flu?
    + **Inference**: Should I take drug X for the flu?
    + **Prediction**: Will *I* get the flu?

## Course Goals

- Be able to conduct a *systematic investigation of a question/problem using data*. In particular:
    + Organize  & manipulate data 
    + Explore & investigate data graphically
    + Deal with variability & estimation
    + Formulate & test statistical hypotheses
    + Discover patterns in data & use them for prediction
    + Develop strong statistical computing skills 
    + Communicate statistical ideas & results effectively

- Purposefully open-ended question; answer various aspects *using data*
     + Collect and examine relevant data
     + Formulate interesting questions 
     + Use data to address them convincingly

## Lecture Goals

- Getting started with R/RStudio
    + Using the RStudio IDE
    + Quick run-through of R
    + Writing *RMarkdown* reports 
    
- Readings
    + Quick guide to [Rmarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html#basics)
    

## RStudio 

- Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) for Linux/Windows/Mac
    + Alternatively, use cloud version at [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)

![](img/Rstudio_screen.png)

## RStudio Workflow 

- Create folder and associated [Rstudio project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)
    + Container for your data, code, and output files

<br>

- Write code (.R/Rmd scripts) in *Editor*
- Run commands/scripts, interact with R in *Console*
- Check available variables/data in *Environment*
- Look at output/documentation/files in *Viewer*

## R Philosophy 

- Information is contained in **objects**
    + E.g. data, variables, models, plots

- Operations are performed by **functions**
    + E.g. sorting data, fitting models, plotting results
    
- Carry out analysis by applying functions to objects

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
my_numbers = 1:3
sum(my_numbers)
```

## R packages

- R comes pre-loaded with basic functions; for extra functionality there are two options: 
    + Create your own: *R programming*
    + Use someone else's: *R Packages*

- **R Packages** are bundles of reusable functions, data, & documentation
    + Packages must be downloaded *once* w/ `install.packages()`
    + To use a package, you must load it into R session w/ `library()`
```{r, collapse = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

## Getting Help

- Get function documentation using `help()` or `?`
    + See description, arguments, results & examples

```{r, collapse = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
help(fun_name)  
? help 
```
   
- For help on packages 
```{r, collapse = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
help( package = "package_name" )
```

## Input/Output

- Read/write tabular data from/to spreadsheet-like file (.csv or comma separated values)
```{r, collapse = TRUE, eval=F}
my_data = read.csv( file = "C:/Users/Sotiris/Documents/data.csv")
write.csv( my_data, file = "C:/Users/Sotiris/Documents/data.csv")
```
- Read/write binary representation of *select* R object 
```{r, collapse = TRUE, eval=F}
save( obj1, obj2, file = "C:/Users/Sotiris/Documents/my_objects.Rdata")
```
- Save *all* objects in `in .RData` file  
```{r, collapse = TRUE, eval=F}
save.image()
```


## Directories

- Absolute file paths ('C:/Users/Sotiris/...') are **BAD** for reproducibility

- Instead, use **relative** paths with respect to your **working directory**
    + Find/set working directory with `getwd()`/`setwd()` 
    + Access working directory directly with
    
```{r, collapse = TRUE, eval=F}
getwd()
my_data = read.csv( file = 'data_folder/data.csv')
```

## R Markdown

- [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a framework for creating *reproducible* reports

- Rmarkdown scripts combine together:
    + R code for performing data analysis
    + [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) code for authoring documents

- Actually, these very slides are written in Rmarkdown

- Let's create your first report with Rmarkdown
