**Goal**: Compare multiple means/proportions with plots and hypothesis tests.


Use the Labout Force Survey data for Toronto.
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
lfs = read_csv('../data/LFS_Toronto.csv') 
```

1. Recreate the following plot, showing the density of job tenure *in years* for employed individuals, *"faceted"* by education level (`educ`).

2. Calculate the *average* tenure in years, broken down by education levels.Based on your results and the previous plot, does average tenure seem the same across education levels?


3. Perfmorm a permutation test for the equality of average tenure across different education levels. Do the results confirm your previous answer?


4. Create a *normalised* barplot showing the proportion of *single* people (`marstat==6`) at different education levels.


5. Test whether the proportion of singles is equal across education levels. What do you conclude?

6. Recreate the following mosaic plot of age group (`age_12`) vs education level.
