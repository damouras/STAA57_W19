*Goal*: Create your first data analysis report in R!

0. Download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), available for Windows/Mac/Linux. If you have trouble installing the software, or have Chrome OS, you can use a web-based version at [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) by opening a free account. 

1. Create a new folder and associated R project called "WS1". Verify your working directory by running `getwd()`

```{r}
# You R code goes here
# (comments start with the pound key "#"" 
# and are not executed)

```

2. Install the `babynames` package on your computer. Either run `install.packages("babynames")` *once* in the console, or go to the *Tools >  Install Packages...*  tab.


3. Load the package by running `library(babynames)`. This will make the `babynames` data available for your R session. Look at the first few lines of data using `head(babynames)`.


4. The file *babynames15.csv* contains the data for 2015 alone. Copy this file in a new subfolder of your working directory named *data*. Read the file into an R object using 
`babynames15 = read.csv("data/babynames15.csv")`. 


5. Print the first few rows of the data using `head(babynames15)`.




6. Create a barplot with the proportion of the most popular female names using:
`barplot( height = head(babynames15)$prop, names.arg = head(babynames15)$name )`.



7. Complete the following mathematical equation 
$$ \sum _{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} = ? $$

Fill in your name and ID \# in the preamble. Then *"knit"* the Rmarkdown document into an html file and submit on Quercus. 


Congratulations, you have created your first Rmarkdown report!
