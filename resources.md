### Computing

![R logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/220px-R_logo.svg.png){:height="25px" width="25px"} We will be using the R programming language for this course.

![Rstudio logo](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RStudio-Ball.png){:height="25px" width="25px"} We will interact with R and other tools through the RStudio IDE.

I recommend you download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)  on your personal computer; both programs are freely available for Linux/Windows/Mac. Alternatively, you can use a web-based version by opening a free account at [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), or go to a UTSC computer lab (all have R/RStudio installed). 

We will be using several R *packages* that add important functionality to R (similar to libraries in Python). We will also be using *RMarkdown* (R's version of the Markdown language) to write reports that combine text with R code, output, and plots. 
 
### Learning R

There are many excellent and free resources for learning R, below is partial list:

#### Books

- [Hands-On Programming with R](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/ighbo26t3ua52t/igp9099yy4v10/igz7vp4w5su9/OReilly_HandsOn_Programming_with_R_2014.pdf), by Garrett Grolemund; great introduction to R for beginners.
- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund; methods & libraries for doing Data Science.
- [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), by Hadley Wickham; for experienced programmers who want to delve deeper.

#### Other 
- [Reference cards](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for the tools we will be using (and more).
- [Style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/index.html) for writing readable R code. 
- [Directory](https://r-dir.com/) with various R resources.
