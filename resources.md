### Computing Tools

![Rstudio logo](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RStudio-Ball.png){:height="25px" width="25px"} We will interact with R (and other tools) through the *RStudio* IDE.

I recommend you download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)  on your personal computer; both programs are freely available for Linux/Windows/Mac. Alternatively, you can use a web-based version by opening a free account at [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), or go to a UTSC computer lab (all have R/RStudio installed). 

We will be using several R *packages* that add important functionality to R (similar to libraries in Python). We will also be using *RMarkdown*, R's version of the Markdown language, to compile reports that combine code, output, and plots with text (similar to Python notebooks). 

 
### Learning R

There is a wealth of freely available resources for learning R. Here is a list of resources that we will be using throughout the course. 

##### Books

- [Hands-On Programming with R, by Garrett Grolemund](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/ighbo26t3ua52t/igp9099yy4v10/igz7vp4w5su9/OReilly_HandsOn_Programming_with_R_2014.pdf); excellent introduction to R for beginners.
- [R for Data Science, by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund](http://r4ds.had.co.nz); teaches you how to do Data Science with R.
- [Advanced R, by Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)



- [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com) offers a free online [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).



If you have never programmed before then Hands-On Programming with R, by Garrett Grolemund is a great place to start.
R for Data Science, by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund is a wonderful resourc
