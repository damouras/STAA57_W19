### Computing Tools

![R logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/220px-R_logo.svg.png){:height="25px" width="25px"} We will be using the *R* programming language for this course.

![Rstudio logo](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RStudio-Ball.png){:height="25px" width="25px"} We will interact with R (and other tools) through the *RStudio* IDE.

I recommend you download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)  on your personal computer; both programs are freely available for Linux/Windows/Mac. Alternatively, you can use a web-based version by opening a free account at [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), or go to a UTSC computer lab (all have R/RStudio installed). 

We will be using several R *packages* that add important functionality to R (similar to libraries in Python). We will also be using *RMarkdown* (R's version of the Markdown language) to write reports that combine text with R code, output, and plots. 

 
### Learning R

There is a wealth of freely available resources for learning R. Here is a list of resources that we will be using throughout the course. 

#### Books

- [Hands-On Programming with R](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/ighbo26t3ua52t/igp9099yy4v10/igz7vp4w5su9/OReilly_HandsOn_Programming_with_R_2014.pdf), by Garrett Grolemund; great introduction to R for beginners.
- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund; teaches how to do Data Science in R using some amazing packages.
- [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), by Hadley Wickham; read if you are an expert programmer and want to know how R work

#### Other 
- [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com) offers a free online [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).
- Useful [reference cards](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for the tools that we will be using (and more).
- A [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/index.html) for writing readable R code. 
- An online [directory](https://r-dir.com/) with various resources.
